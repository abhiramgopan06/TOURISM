        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Our story began with a simple belief — that nature has the power to heal, inspire, and bring people closer
            together. What started as a small passion for exploring forest trails and hidden waterfalls soon grew into a
            mission to share the untouched beauty of the wild with others. We created this forest tourism experience to
            help travelers step away from busy city life and rediscover the peace found beneath towering trees and open
            skies. Every journey we design is rooted in respect for nature, sustainability, and authentic adventure.
            From guided treks to quiet moments around a campfire, our goal is to create meaningful experiences that
            connect people with the forest and with themselves. This is more than travel — it is a return to where we
            truly belong.
